# Search Algorithms Visualization and Analysis

Welcome to the Search Algorithms Visualization and Analysis project! This project is designed to help you understand, visualize, and compare various search algorithms used in artificial intelligence and computer science.

## Overview

Search algorithms are fundamental in AI and computer science, and this project provides an interactive platform to explore their workings and analyze their performance. You can visualize how algorithms like Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, A* Search, and more, navigate through different search spaces and find solutions.

## Features

- Visualize different search algorithms in action.
- Compare the performance of algorithms using various metrics.
- Understand the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.
- Experiment with different input scenarios and search problems.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred development environment.
3. Run the application to start the visualization and analysis tool.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Select the search algorithm you want to visualize.
3. Provide the search space or problem you'd like to solve.
4. Observe the algorithm's progress and results through the visual interface.
5. Analyze the algorithm's performance metrics and insights.
